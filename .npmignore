# Since package.json "files" field restricts to "dist" folder only,
# this .npmignore just ensures certain files are excluded if they
# accidentally end up in dist during build

# Test files that might end up in dist
*.test.js
*.test.d.ts
*.spec.js
*.spec.d.ts

# Source maps (if we generate them)
*.map

# TypeScript config files
tsconfig*.json

# Any accidental source files
*.ts
!*.d.ts
